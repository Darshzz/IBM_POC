This POC is build on `VIP Architecture`, purely-Swift code and design is managed by using Storyboard. It renders an list of cars with certain useful details for user. And also they are rendered on Map. So here for map functionality `Google Maps` are used. 
Caching of images is handled by a third party library knows as `Kingfisher`.
A separate `Network Layer` is written to trigger Api's.

## Features

- [x] `Clean (VIP) Architecture` understanding
- [x] `Network Layer` is written while keeping in mind the `Solid Principles`
